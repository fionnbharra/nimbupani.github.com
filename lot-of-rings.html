<div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, I guess there is no harm putting in spoilers. It was an awesome movie. There were more special effects than I had ever seen. Extremely good locations. Lovely battles. Some good war speeches. Aragorn was looking so regal.</p>

<p>BUT.. but but.. there was so much grossness that I could have puked. Especially the first scene of the worm EEEEEKS. I was shocked. Then was the scene of Gollums transformation.. EEYEW.. that was gory.</p>

<p>And well, its boring in a way that the world is neatly divided into black and white. The orcs are always black, deformed and heartless. The good are all fair, righteous and only the ring will awaken the bad qualities among them. Of course the only exception of a bad fair man was Saruaman. I was quite angry that they never gave a proper ending to his story. Perhaps the actor refused to renew his contract? :)</p>

<p>And yes, the lack of any romance, save for a kiss, between Arwen and Aragorn. Eh, what kind of love it is, which happens only in dreams? Weird! And whatever love could develop between Aragorn and Eowyn  is lost even in the movie. Many people are <a href="http://www.dm.net/~theswan/kramer2.html">having thoughts</a> on the fast marriage between Eowyn and Faramir. Bah! it was a very bad attempt to have a &#8220;happily here after&#8221; ending. And weirdly we never get to see Sauron. Only his &#8216;eye&#8217;. Well, so much for the bad parts.</p>

<p>But here is the trivia, did you know that the Treebeard and Gimli are played by the same person? Christopher Lee of Dracula fame  played Saruman?  Did you know that the director of LOTR also appears in the LOTR (TTT) as a soldier of Rohan!</p>

<p>Have you seen the actors without their beards (Aragorn, Gandalf)? They don&#8217;t look regal at all I mean I can&#8217;t imagine that they were transformed into the glorious heroes with the excellent make-up and clothes.</p>
