<div class="entry-content"><p>On the marked day, me and <a href="http://www.selectiveamnesia.org">ravages</a> (who very kindly gave me a lift to and from the venue, thanks a zillion chandru!) made it to the watering hole quite early. While we were waiting for others to turn up, a stern looking waiter left a note which stated there was a Rs.25 cover charge for sitting in that place without ordering! So, we ordered some stuff (me going for the  cheapest, which was coincidentally Rs. 25) when <a href="http://www.kiruba.com">Kribs</a> and <a href="http://benvsben.blogdrive.com/">Alex</a> trooped in. Kribs had this idea of putting tags so people will find it easy to identify themselves with the urls :). Me and ravages were entrusted with the responsibility of writing down the names. I had this wild idea of writing something nasty about each of them in the name tags and promptly turned over the idea to the ad man Ravages who did do a great job of it :) (you can see some of the tags in lazygeek&#8217;s snaps).</p>

<p>By five people started trooping in and a round chair conference started. <a href="http://www.mdeii.blogspot.com">Anand</a>, the film maker wannabe, was the funny bunny :) (no offence anand!), who regaled the people with funny repartees along with lazygeek. The matyrs of the event were <a href="http://www.kingsley2.com">Kingsley</a> and <a href="http://sudhon.blogspot.com">Sudhon</a>, who made it despite their respective illnesses.<a href="http://www.cyberbrahma.com/rants/"> S.K.</a>, the wise forever young man :) talked about his experiences as a webmaster for Indian Railways and those of you in India who wish to have unlimited internet access for free, please start looking at the Recruitment ads for Railways IT positions!</p>

<p>Soon, it was dusk and mosquitoes got the better of kribs and we took pity on the blog evangelist and started dispersing. This was a period for some more interaction where I met <a href="http://ravikumar.blogdrive.com">Ravikumar</a>, who had tremendous respect and admiration for Lee Kuan Yew and for Singapore in general. Dinesh has described me as a &#8220;girl who does not like PSBBians or IITans&#8221;, but please! no! I just don&#8217;t like the fact that everyone seems to find some sort of common brotherhood (or sisterhood for the feminists), under &#8220;IIT&#8221; or &#8220;PSBB&#8221; and i seem to have none :P. Lazygeek found a shorter nickname for me:&#8221;pani&#8221; :P</p>

<p>I also found out, my name is too common, and this is the second such occurence (of somebody&#8217;s girlfriend having same name as mine). The first was(is) an interesting experience, with people trying to call her (including her boyfriend) would call me and then  give embarassing excuses :)</p>

<p>I then exited from the scene and enjoyed a scenic ride across madras thanks to ravages. On the whole, a very interesting experience. I know I sound like a reporter of some of those cheap neighbourhood newspapers, but then my blog report is finished.</p>

<p><a href="http://arsenalsri.rediffblogs.com/">Sri</a> has a list of bloggers who attended the meet</a> and the pics of course are at <a href="http://www.lazygeek.net">Lazygeek</a>.</p>
